## Introduction

This guide provides detailed, self-contained and actionable technical instructions for integrating and federating a marketplace in DOME.  
It is meant to be the reference for what is _currently_ technically available and ready to be used. When additional functionality, components and/or 
instruction get available, this guide will be adapted accordingly.

This guide limits on the technical details and therefore is not providing any details about contractual 
and business aspects of the marketplace integration and federation.


### Who is this guide for?

This guide aims for future participants willing to technically integrate and federate a marketplace in DOME. Descriptions and instructions are 
given as a comprehensive, step-by-step guide in such detail, so that IT and engineering teams can successfully and efficiently 
perform the necessary steps without profound knowledge of the DOME implementation details.

Nevertheless, this guide focusses on the actual integration of a marketplace in DOME, providing only the information 
needed to perform the actual setup for integration and federation. More details and in-depth knowledge about DOME and its involved 
components can be found in the linked resources.

The suggested deployment target infrastructure is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Therefore a sufficient 
knowledge of Kubernetes and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is expected when following this guide. Knowledge about 
[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is also helpful when using it as GitOps 
continuous delivery tool.  
This guide requires access to a domain and it's DNS settings, as well as configuring proper certificates. 
Therefore also knowledge about [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) 
and [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is recommended.  
Authentication requires usage of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, which requires an 
appropriate configuration of the related components. Therefore, the reader of this guide should be 
familiar with [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [VC/VP standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).





### What is DOME?

Cloud computing is identified as a central piece of Europeâ€™s digital future, giving European
businesses and public organisations the data processing technology required to support their
digital transformation. 
The European Commission thereby stepped up its efforts to support
cloud uptake in Europe as part of its strategy, notably with the pledge to facilitate "the set-up
of a cloud services marketplace for EU users from the private and public sector". 
DOME is
materialising the envisioned online marketplace, providing the means for accessing trusted
services, notably cloud and edge services, building blocks deployed under the Common
Services Platform and more generally any software and data processing services developed
under EU programmes such as the Digital Europe Programme, Horizon 2020 or Horizon
Europe.

Relying on Gaia-X concepts and open standards, DOME is providing the finishing touch to the
technical building that the Digital Europe Program is creating for boosting the development
and adoption of trusted Cloud and Edge services in Europe. It will provide the single point for
enabling customers and service providers to meet each other in a trustful manner. DOME is 
taking the form of a federated collection of marketplaces connected to a shared digital catalogue
of cloud and edge services. Each of the federated marketplaces will be independent or
connected to the offering of a given cloud/edge infrastructure service provider which, in turn,
can be classified as cloud IaaS providers or cloud platform service providers (each of which
provide a platform targeted to solve the integration of vertical data/application services from a
given vertical domain, like smart cities or smart farming, or the integration of certain type of
data/application services, e.g., AI services). DOME is relying on the adoption of common open
standards for the description and the management of the lifecycle of cloud and edge service
products and offerings around those products, as well as their access or match-making
services through a shared catalogue.



### What will I accomplish following this guide?

After following this guide, you will have a complete and functioning integration of a marketplace 
in a federated DOME environment.

The following sections provide details about the necessary steps:
* [Onboarding](#onboarding-as-a-dome-participant): How to perform onboarding as DOME participant (Note, 
  that this topic is currently under discussion and details will be added later).
* [Distributed components](#distributed-components): How to configure, deploy and operate the different 
  required components. This involves the access node and components required for the IAM.
* [Authentication](#authentication): How to authenticate at services and how to implement the authentication.
* [Integration API](#integration-api-tmforum): How to integrate with the TMForum APIs, especially when using an 
  own marketplace implementation instead of the BAE. Some samples and tutorials are given for core federation 
  scenarios.
* [Policies](#policies): How access policies are defined, created and enforced (Note, 
  that this topic is currently under discussion and details will be added later).



### Pre-requisites

There are some prerequisites that need to be fulfilled before following this guide:
* Domain: You need control over an own domain and have access to the DNS settings.
* Public access: Certain components need to be publicly accessible under your own domain. Therefore, a suitable 
  infrastructure (like a cloud-hosted Kubernetes cluster) is required for running the components.
  
Additional prerequisites are provided in the different sections.





## Onboarding as a DOME Service Provider with did:web

### What will I accomplish following this section?

We describe here the onboarding process using Verifiable Credentials with the `did:web` DID method. In production (June 2024) the process will use `did:elsi` and eIDAS certificates, but this process will be finished in the coming weeks, so for the moment the users will be able to test onboarding and creation of Product Offerings and replication to other marketplaces, even if the actions do not have yet the legal coverage that `did:elsi` provides.

The user will be able to login with her Wallet in the DOME BAE Marketplace instance (the one operated at this moment by the DOME project) as a Service Provider with a unique identity determined by the domain (e.g., www.in2.es) used when generating the Verifiable Credential used to login to the BAE Marketplace.

Once logged-in, the user will be able to test the creation of a Product Offering using the screens of the DOME BAE Marketplace instance, and publish the Product Offering in the marketplace. The Product Offering will be replicated to all other federated marketplaces connected to the main DOME Marketplace instance.

All Product Offerings and related entities created under this identity will be separated from the other entities created by other identities.

### Pre-requisites

This scenario uses the [`did:web` DID Method](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/), so you need control over a domain and have access to the DNS settings.

Before continuing, you have to create your DID, following the instructions in the section [Create (Register)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/#create-register) of the `did:web` specification.

### Install and configure Keycloack as a Verifiable Credential Issuer

You need to be able to issue a Verifiable Credential to a Wallet, using the DOME format and with the `did:web` method. There are different possibilities, but the easiest one which ensures compatibility with the current status of the OID4SSI implementation in DOME is to use the Wallet and Issuer provided by DOME.

**Wallet**: in order to use the Wallet provided by DOME, you do not have to install anything. Just visit with your mobile the URL: https://demo-wallet.fiware.dev/

**Issuer**: the Issuer is a little bit more involved. Before June, DOME will provide an Issuer acting As-a-Service (for those willing to use it), but for the moment you have to install and operate an instance the Issuer yourself.

The instructions to install and configure the Issuer (which is based on Keycloack) are here: [Keycloack VC-Issuer](https://github.com/FIWARE/keycloak-vc-issuer). For a simple installation, the repo includes a containerised deployment so you only have to configure the Issuer with your specific information.

The Wallet should be able to access the relevant endpoints exposed by the Issuer, as described in the instrucions mentioned above.

### Configure the Credential type and the Claims in the Issuer

Follow the instructions in [Configure claims for Credential-Types](https://github.com/FIWARE/keycloak-vc-issuer?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-claims-for-credential-types) to configure your Issuer for issuance of the Credential required for DOME.

### Issue and receive the Verifiable Credential in your Wallet

Follow the instructions in section [Demo](https://github.com/FIWARE/keycloak-vc-issuer?tab=readme-ov-file#demo) to make Keycloack issue a QR code that can be scanned by your Wallet (remember that your Wallet is at https://demo-wallet.fiware.dev/).

Once you scan the QR code and complete the issuance process, you will have in your Wallet the required credentials to login in the DOME BAE Marketplace.

### Login to the DOME BAE Marketplace instance

At this moment, you have in your mobile the credentials required to login to the DOME BAE Marketplace instance with a unique identity associated to your unique domain. Even though this credential does not have the level of legal certainty required for production use, it will allow you to test the features that the DOME BAE Marketplace instance provides to Service Providers.

> TODO: add instructions to login to the DOME BAE Marketplace instance.

### Create a Product Offering in the DOME BAE Marketplace instance

Once logged in, you are logged as a Service Provider with a unique identity associated to your unique domain. You can start creating Product Offerings and publishing them. The action of publishing the Product Offernings will make them visible to potential customers in the DOME BAE Marketplace instance and all other federated marketplaces which are connected to the DOME main instance.

> TODO: add instructions to create and publish Product Offerings.

### Logoff from the DOME BAE Marketplace instance

Once you have finished interacting with the DOME BAE Marketplace instance, you can logoff from it. In case of inactivity, the BAE Marketplace will log you off automatically.

Using your Wallet, you can login at any moment and continue working with the DOME BAE Marketplace. The Wallet has your credentials stored in your device and you can use them at any moment.


## Distributed components

> Components that need to be operated by a federated participant.

### Access Node

The [DOME Access-Node](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/access-node) is a set of services, that can be used to access
the DOME Marketplace. A registered participant can use it to act as a federated marketplace in DOME.

The Access-Nodes consists of 3 logical building blocks:

![Building Blocks](doc/img/building-blocks.png)

The TM-Forum-API Service is a service providing a growing subset of
the [TMForum API](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/open-apis/table)'s while using
an [NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.06.01_60/gs_CIM009v010601p.pdf) context broker as
persistence backend and change notificator.

    TM-Forum-API --> Context-Broker;
    Context-Broker --> Persistence;
```

The Blockchain Connector is a software component that facilitates the
interaction between the Off-Chain Storage (Context Broker) and the
On-Chain Storage (Blockchain). 
It is composed of the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and the Access Node.

#### Overview and sub-components

The TM-Forum-API service is a cluster of individual services providing one specific API each, enabling the participant
to only run the necessary subset for its use-case.
Apart from offering CRUD operations on the managed entities, the service also enables the subscription to notifications
based on given queries.

The services are stateless and support horizontal scaling, but require an external cache to avoid having inconsistent
caches. Inconsistent caches can result from either changes due to calls to the API, or due to notifications for changes
reported by the underlying persistence. If run in a single instance mode, a local cache is acceptable but for larger
setups a [Redis](https://redis.io/) installation is recommended.

For reasons of convenience, the TM-Forum-API service can be deploying with
an [Envoy API proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) which provides the individual APIs via a single service, routed based
on the path. Another convenient feature is a [RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com/) container, that can be deployed with the
TM-Forum-API service that provides a Openapi based API documentation for the deployed services, with the functionality
of querying the API too.

The requirement for the persistence is to be compliant to the NGSI-LD API v1.6 enabling the use of different available
context brokers. The currently recommended Context-Broker for the access node
is [Scorpio](https://github.com/ScorpioBroker/ScorpioBroker), mainly due to good cloud integration and overall support.
The Scorpio context-broker allows a variety of adjustments to cover the operator's specific needs ( e.g. horizontal
scaling utilizing [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)) and uses [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) as it's
persistence layer. The Postgresql is extended with [Postgis](https://postgis.net/) for supporting geospatial data.

#### Infrastructure requirements

The base memory consumption per deployed pod is listed below but is will increase with the amount of traffic, therefor
should only be used as a rough estimate.

| Service            | Memory (Mi) |
|--------------------|-------------|
| TM-Forum-API Pod   | 250         |
| Scorpio            | 400         |
| Postgresql/Postgis | 150         |
| Redis              | 10          |
|                    |             |
|                    |             |

Apart from the database service, no other service will maintain a own persistence, therefor only for this service a
persistent volume claim has to be dimensioned.

#### How to deploy

The recommended and endorsed way of deployment is via the provided helm charts ( optionally wrapped in ArgoCD
Applications).

To deploy a setup,
the [umbrella chart](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#complex-charts-with-many-dependencies) of the
access-node can be used as followed:

- create a configuration values file according to the own environment, as described [here](#how-to-configure).
- add helm chart repository to helm installation
  ```
    helm repo add dome-access-node https://dome-marketplace.github.io/access-node
    helm repo update
  ```
  > :bulb: All releases of the Access-Node reside in the helm-repository https://dome-marketplace.github.io/access-node.
  In addition to that, all Pre-Release versions(build from the Pull Requests) are provided in the
  pre-repo https://dome-marketplace.github.io/access-node/pre. The pre-repo will be cleaned-up from time to time, in
  order to keep the index manageable.

- install the components using the prepared configuration
  ```
    helm install <RELEASE_NAME> dome-access-node/access-node --namespace <NAME_SPACE> --version <CHART_VERSION> -f values.yaml
  ```

#### How to configure

The chart is released with a set
of [default values](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/access-node/blob/main/charts/access-node/values.yaml) which act
as a good starting point for an adoption. These values are also documented, enhancing the understanding. Additionally,
the [respective charts](https://github.com/FIWARE/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/tm-forum-api) of the components should be
consulted.

| Component           | Chart                                                                       |

| scorpio-broker      | https://github.com/FIWARE/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/scorpio-broker       |

To have a starting point, the [this](./config/accessnode.yaml) minimal config reduces the configuration to items that are likely changed by integrators.
Blockchain connector fields present int this file are:

The Blockchain Connector uses the _dev_, _test_ and _prod_ configuration profiles. On the other hand, DOME uses the 
profile names _sbx_, _dev_ and _prd_. It is important that users use the profile names used by the Blockchain Connector 
(_dev_, _test_, _prod_), since the application is responsible for carrying out the necessary correspondence and mapping 
between the profile names of the Blockchain Connector and those of DOME automatically.

The DLT-Adapter is automatically deactivated when it detects that Desmos is down.

##### Desmos profiles
Table to clarify the relation between the desmos-api profiles and the DOME-Gitops environments:

| desmos-api profiles  | DOME-Gitops environments |
|:--------------------:|:------------------------:|
|         dev          |           sbx            |
|         test         |           dev            |
|         prod         |           prd            |

##### Configure custom secrets

While secrets can be configured via plain helm/k8s entities, another more secure approach is to use [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets). To configure custom secrets you have to follow the next steps:

1. **Create a Plain Secret Manifest File:**
- Create a plain secret manifest file named ```<secret name>-plain-secret.yaml```. 
- **IMPORTANT**: Add "*-plain-secret.yaml" to .gitignore file to not push plain secret data to the repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <secret name>
  namespace: <app namespace>
data: 
  <secret_key>: <base64 encoded value>
```

2. **Seal the secret:**
- Seal the secret by executing the following command:

```sh
kubeseal -f <secret name>-plain-secret.yaml -w <secret name>-sealed-secret.yaml --controller-namespace sealed-secrets --controller-name sealed-secrets
```

3. **Apply the secret configuration:**
- Apply the sealed secret configuration to the cluster by running the command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f <secret name>-sealed-secret.yaml
```

4. **Update the Chart Values:**
- In the chart values.yaml file, modify the existingSecret section as follows:

```yaml
existingSecret:  
  enabled: true  
  name: <secret name>  
  key: <secret_key>
```

#### How to validate a deployment

All components are configured with health and readiness checks to validate their own status, therefor being the base for
a validation. These checks are utilized in the kubernetes checks as defined in the helm charts.

> TODO: Include RapiDoc Container for validation and add explanation here

#### How to operate

> - Management/admin APIs.
>- Instrumentation, metrics, logs, alerts

The underlying database service holds the persisted data and therefor requires a backup&recovery mechanism when operated
in a production environment. The use of managed database is strongly encouraged for safety and convenience.

The TM-Forum-API service used a json based log output by default, which can be parsed easily by log aggregators but can
also be replaced if needed. The verbosity is controlled
via [environment variables](https://github.com/FIWARE/helm-charts/blob/05552c4c97a21df68f14e78de80a56e3934e179d/charts/tm-forum-api/templates/deployment.yaml#L165)
and can be fine tuned to the operators needs.

We need to implement Grafana dashboards but for the moment the access node publishes metrics for Prometheus by default
in "/actuator/prometheus".


#### How to update

Upgrade to both a different chart version and new configuration can be accomplished with the following command

  ```
    helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> dome-access-node/access-node --namespace <NAME_SPACE> --version <CHART_VERSION> -f values.yaml
  ```

#### Release process

Versioning of the main access-node helm chart is handled based on the labels used in the pull requests used to introduce
changes and is enforced in
the [build pipeline](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/access-node/tree/main/.github/workflows). The requester and
reviewers must set the label according to the [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme.

Versioning of the components and sub-charts is recommended to use the same scheme.

##### Timeouts occur while querying TM-Forum-API

When encountering timeouts in calls to the TM-Forum-API service it is possible to mitigate the imminent issue by
increasing the timeout of the client (called "ngsi") calling the NGSI-LD broker. The
necessary [client](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.http.client.ServiceHttpClientConfiguration)
and [server](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/configurationreference.html#io.micronaut.http.server.HttpServerConfiguration)
configuration can be handed in
via [additional environment variables](https://github.com/FIWARE/helm-charts/blob/05552c4c97a21df68f14e78de80a56e3934e179d/charts/tm-forum-api/templates/deployment.yaml#L243-L249).

### IAM components

The [DOME IAM-Framework](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/iam-components) is a set of microservices, that enables
users in the DOME ecosystem to authenticate into the [DOME Marketplace](https://dome-marketplace.org). The authentication process itself is
described further below in the [Authentication](#authentication) section.

#### Overview and subcomponents

The DOME IAM-Framework consists of multiple open-source components. The components are not required to be used, as long
as alternatives providing the same interfaces are used.

The IAM-Framework consists of following components:

![IAM-components](doc/img/iam.png)

* The [Trusted Issuers List](https://github.com/fiware/trusted-issuers-list) service provides an [EBSI Trusted Issuers Registry](https://hub.ebsi.eu/apis/pilot/trusted-issuers-registry/v4) implementation to act as
the Trusted-List-Service in the DSBA Trust and IAM Framework. In addition, a Trusted-Issuers-List API is provided to
manage the issuers.
* [VCVerifier](https://github.com/fiware/vcverifier) provides the necessary endpoints to offer SIOP-2/OIDC4VP compliant authentication flows. It exchanges
VerifiableCredentials for JWT, that can be used for authorization and authentication in down-stream components.
* [Credentials Config Service](https://github.com/fiware/credentials-config-service) manages and provides information about services and the credentials they are using.
It returns the scope to be requested from the wallet per service. Furthermore, it specifies the credentials required and
the issuers list endpoints to validate against, when checking access for a certain service.
* The [Keycloak-VC-Issuer](https://github.com/fiware/keycloak-vc-issuer) is plugin for Keycloak to support SIOP-2/OIDC4VP clients and issue VerifiableCredentials through
the OIDC4VCI-Protocol to compliant wallets.
* [PDP](https://github.com/fiware/dsba-pdp) is an implementation of a Policy-Decision Point, evaluating Json-Web-Tokens containing VerifiableCredentials in a
DSBA-compliant way. It also supports the evaluation in the context of i4Trust.
* [Keyrock](https://github.com/ging/fiware-idm) is the FIWARE component responsible for Identity Management. Within DOME IAM-Framework, currently Keyrock is being
used as the iSHARE-compliant Authorization Registry (see for details: https://dev.ishare.eu/delegation/endpoint.html),
where attribute-based access policies are stored and used during the authorization process. Note, that this will be replaced by an ODRL-compliant 
policy registry. A description of the policies is given in the [policies](#policies) section.
* [Kong Plugins](https://github.com/fiware/kong-plugins-fiware) allow to extend the API Gateway Kong by further functionalities. Kong Gateway is a lightweight,
fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway. One of the plugins is the PEP plugin, which is especially required within
the IAM-components as PEP component and interacts with the PDP mentioned above.
* [Waltid](https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-ssikit) manages Keys, DIDs and VCs. It is used by VC Issuer and VCVerifier.

#### How to deploy

The recommended way of deployment is via the provided [Helm charts](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/iam-components).

To deploy a setup,
the [umbrella chart](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/#complex-charts-with-many-dependencies) of the
iam-components can be used as followed:

- create a configuration values file according to the own environment, as described [here](#how-to-configure-1).
- add helm chart repository to helm installation
  ```
    helm repo add dome-iam https://dome-marketplace.github.io/iam-components
    helm repo update
  ```
  > :bulb: All releases of the IAM-components reside in the helm-repository https://dome-marketplace.github.io/iam-components.
  In addition to that, all Pre-Release versions(build from the Pull Requests) are provided in the
  pre-repo https://dome-marketplace.github.io/iam-components/pre. The pre-repo will be cleaned-up from time to time, in
  order to keep the index manageable.

- install the components using the prepared configuration
  ```
    helm install <RELEASE_NAME> dome-iam/iam-components --namespace <NAME_SPACE> --version <CHART_VERSION> -f values.yaml
  ```

#### How to configure

The chart is released with a set
of documented [default values](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/iam-components/blob/main/charts/iam-components/values.yaml).
The parameters listed below are important to set and should be updated at least:

* `rbac` and `serviceAccount`: Depending on your requirements, you might need to adapt settings for RBAC and service
  account
* `did`s of participants: Replace/add the DIDs of the issuer and other participants
* In the case of did:key provide correct key in [keyfile.json](https://github.com/DOME-Marketplace/iam-components/blob/main/charts/iam-components/templates/keycloak.yaml) for your issuer
* `keycloak.frontendUrl`: Externally accessible address of the keycloak (should be the same as defined in ingress/route)
* `keycloak.realm`: Adapt clients, users and roles according to your needs
* `<tir.com>`: replace everywhere with actual TIR URL
* `<dome-marketplace.org>`: replace with your own domain
* `keyrock.initData.scriptData`: Adapt the roles as in keycloak realm
* `kong.configMap`: Adapt the kong services and their routes

However, 
it is suggested to consult the respective charts listed below and check their documentation and configuration.
